# a summary about you
summary: 'I am a passionate junior software engineer with my story beginning at the age of four when I received my first computer. Ever since, my life has revolved around technology and how it interacts and operates. As I was getting older, my parents took note of my interest and start enrolling my in tech camps such as Kids-N-Technology that further increased my curiosity and knowledge. As I progressed through my young adult years, I enrolled at Mississippi State University and took up Computer Science courses where I would start my journey into software development. A few years later I found myself enrolled in a six-month bootcamp at CodeCrew Code School in Memphis,TN where I would further enhance my knowledge and learn web development.'
